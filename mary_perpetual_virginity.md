  Several scriptures mention the brothers (and sisters) of Christ.
  </summary>
  <blockquote>

"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him. [Mark 6:3]

"Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?" [Matthew 13:55]

Now the Jewish festival of Booths was near. So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing; for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret. If you do these things, show yourself to the world." (For not even his brothers believed in him.) 6 Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil. Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival, for my time has not yet fully come." [John 7:2-8]

All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers. [Acts 1:14]

Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? [1 Corinthian 9:5]

But I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord’s brother. [Galations 1:19]

When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus. [Matthew 1:24-25]

"...the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James"

  <blockquote>

In arguing against Helvidius' claim that Mary had other children after Jesus, Jerome suggests Irenaeus (among others) agreed with him that Mary had no other biological children:
"Might I not array against you the whole series of ancient writers? Ignatius, Polycarp, <b>Irenaeus</b>, Justin Martyr, and many other apostolic and eloquent men, who against [the heretics] Ebion, Theodotus of Byzantium, and Valentinus, held these same views and wrote volumes replete with wisdom. If you had ever read what they wrote, you would be a wiser man" (Against Helvidius: The Perpetual Virginity of Mary 19 [A.D. 383]). Available online <a href='http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3007.htm'>here</a>.

However, in researching the topic while I was able to find people from both sides of the issue saying Irenaeus supported their side, I have not found a clear reference for either side.

This writer sums it up well:

"Did St. Irenaeus’ marvelous penetration into the virginal conception of Christ carry him on to further precisions concerning Our Lady’s virginity? Unfortunately, no, at least according to those authentic writings of his which have come down to us for the most part only in translations; there is nothing in these translated passages to show that Irenaeus held the permanence of Mary’s virginity, i.e., after the Annunciation, in the birth of Christ, and thereafter to the end of her life on earth. Certain critics (128) have believed themselves justified in holding that Irenaeus denied Mary’s perpetual virginity, but without any decisive proof; (129) on the other hand, we must confess that there are no decisive texts to show the opposite."

Note that all the specific citations I've found are unclear, and can be interpreted in other fashions. However it is clear other people closer to Tertullian's time believed he thought Mary had other children after Jesus.

"The Book [the Protoevangelium] of James [records] that the brethren of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he married before Mary.

And I think it in harmony with reason that Jesus was the firstfruit among men of the purity which consists in [perpetual] chastity, and Mary was among women. For it were not pious to ascribe to any other than to her the firstfruit of virginity" (Commentary on Matthew 2:17 [A.D. 248]).

"Because there are those who dare to say that Mary cohabited with Joseph after she bore the Redeemer, we reply, 'How would it have been possible for her who was the home of the indwelling of the Spirit, whom the divine power overshadowed, that she be joined by a mortal being, and gave birth filled with birthpangs, in the image of the primeval curse?'

For "he did not know her" - it says - "until she gave birth to a Son, her firstborn" (Mt 1:25). But this could make one suppose that Mary, after having offered in all purity her own sevice in giving birth to the Lord, by virtue of the intervention of the Holy Spirit, did not subsequently refrain from normal conjugal relations.

That would not have affected the teaching of our religion at all, because Mary's virginity was necessary until the service of the Incarnation, and what happened afterward need not be investigated in order to affect the doctrine of the mystery.

But since the <b>lovers of Christ do not allow themselves to hear that the Mother of God ceased at a given moment to be a virgin, we consider their testimony to be sufficient.</b>

Under the word 'brethren' the Hebrews include all cousins and other relations, whatever may be the degree of affinity.

"I believe that He [Jesus] was made man, joining the human nature with the divine in one person; being conceived by the singular operation of the Holy Ghost, and born of the blessed Virgin Mary, who, as well after as before she brought Him forth, continued a pure and unspotted virgin."

  Biblical argument against Mary's perpetual virginity
  </summary>
  <blockquote>

Psalm 69:8: "I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's sons."

This is a messianic psalm, and here the term brothers is unambiguous (mother's sons).

----------------

Matthew 1:24-25: "When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus."

In saying "knew her not until she had given birth to a son", this implies Mary and Joseph had customary marital relations after the birth of Jesus.

----------------

There's a problem in claiming Jesus' brothers/sisters were cousins or other kinsmen. There is an exact term for cousin, 'anepsios', which is used elsewhere in the New Testament (Colossians 4:10). There is also a word for kinsmen, 'suggenes', which is used elsewhere (Luke 1:36). Instead the New Testament writers use 'adelphos', whose primary meaning speaks of a relationship of shared parentage (which is what should be assumed unless context suggests otherwise).

  Biblical argument for Mary's perpetual virginity

Matthew 1:24-25: "When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not <b>until [ἕως]</b> she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus."

Often times it is said that by the word "until", this verse implies Mary and Joseph had customary marital relations after the birth of Jesus. The word until here in Greek is 'ἕως'. This is the same word used in Matthew 28:19-20.

Matthew 28:19-20: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, <b>until [ἕως]</b> the end of the age."

If we were interpret ἕως [until] in the same sense for Matthew 28 as it is suggested we do for Matthew 1, it appears Jesus is saying he will be with us until the end of the age, and then will cease to be with us - which is nonsense. Similar nonsense  occurs in other passages that use the same word (2 Samuel 6:23, Genesis 8:7, and Deuteronomy 34:6) if we follow this interpretation. Therefore, Matthew 1:25 is not implying Mary and Joseph had customary marital relations after the birth of Jesus.

----------------

John 19:26-27: "When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, 'Woman, behold, your son!' Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold, your mother!' And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home."

If Mary had other sons, it seems strange and out of character that Jesus would have gone out of his way to disregard family ties and commit a grave dishonor to his brothers by entrusting his mother to another man.

----------------

Adelphos, the word used when speaking of the brothers and sisters of Christ, is not only used to refer to biological brothers but also to relatives (Genesis 14:14, 29:15), close friends (2 Samuel 1:26, 1 Kings 9:13) or even allies (Amos 1:9).

----------------

When Jesus went to the temple at the age of 12, there is no mention of other children in his family (Luke 2:41-51).

----------------

It is noteworthy that in scriptures even when Jesus is referred to as the son of Mary, Jesus' brothers are never referred to that way.
